# Concept of ERP roles

An _Account_ in CE is associated with multiple _ERP Role_ records (e.g., Hermos, Belectric). Each ERP Role corresponds to a specific company in F&O and synchronizes with a _Customer_ record in that company. Additionally, a _Party_ record is created in the Global Address Book of F&O to represent the shared identity across legal entities. This setup enables centralized account management in CE while maintaining company-specific customer records in F&O.
